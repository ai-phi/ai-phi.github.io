description: "From creative studios to classrooms and boardrooms, generative AI is reshaping the way we work, learn, and imagine. This first Causerie of AI-Phi 3.0 invites an open discussion on the hopes and anxieties surrounding this technology: from the promise of universal creativity and efficiency to the spectre of runaway intelligence. Together with Edmund Ronald, weâ€™ll reflect on how trust, safety, and understanding evolve as AI spreads through everyday life."

## Generative AI Everywhere - Hopes, Fears, Trust, Understanding, Regulation

Generative AI is spreading rapidly worldwide, both in private use and in corporate environments. Among many novel promises, it ostends friendly assistance to the programmer, immediate realization of artwork and music for the creative, tailor-made teaching for anyone connected to the internet, universal remote diagnostic medicine, and of course optimisation of business processes and heightened efficiency. However doomsayers such as Nobel prize winner Hinton warn of the inevitability of runaway intelligence, and the extinction of humanity.

This Causerie is about the social emotions projected onto AI, namely Hope, Fear, and Trust. We will frame the process by which generative AI now percolates from research into widespread use in society, and offer participants an opportunity to debate the arguments for boom and gloom, safety real and perceived, risks and safeguards.
