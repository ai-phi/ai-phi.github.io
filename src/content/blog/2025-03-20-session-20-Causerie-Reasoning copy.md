A growing trend in AI, and particularly visible through commercial applications such as ChatGPT, is the development of models that can reason.

But beyond this new impulsion, the notion of reasoning has deep roots in both AI and philosophy.

During this session, short presentations will review majors developments in our understanding of artificial reasoning to ground a discussion on their implications.

*Everyone is welcome to share reading material with the group on our usual channels or prepare a few slides to add to the discussion.*
