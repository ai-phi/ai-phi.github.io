After years of friendly discussions about AI and philosophy during afterwork hours, AÃ¯da Elamrani (ENS Ulm), Michael Anslow and Stefan Lattner (both from Sony CSL) decided it was time to turn this energy in something more substantial. AI-PHI was born in the Quartier Latin from their friendship and shared passion.

The AI-PHI community involves researchers and professionals from diverse backgrounds, cultures and disciplines.
