After Daniel Kahneman, another great thinker - Daniel Dennett - left us. Therefore, in the upcoming ai-phi session, we will continue with our particular format: We will watch an interview with Daniel Dennett about his ideas about consciousness, qualia, and the hard problem, which was conducted around four years ago. These sessions are meant to foster interactive discussions, and we can pause from time to time, to engage in topics of interest.
