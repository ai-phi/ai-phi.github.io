## FONTLOG for Velvelyne

This file provides detailed information on the Demo font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Demo fonts and any derivative works.

## Basic Font Information

Velvelyne is a bio-mechanical typeface designed for the Velvetyne website.
Its skeleton was designed by a script devised by Benjamin Dumond. Responding to RaphaÃ«l Bastide's orchestration, the shapes grew out of the Liberation Sans typeface. Manon Van der Borght and Mariel Nils then nurtured this skeleton until it developed branches and fibres and took on its outgrowths. As it grew, this stroke font expanded into 4 weights, post-binary ligatures and a handful of pictograms.

## Information for Contributors

Velvelyne is released under the CUTE V.01 - https://genderfluid.space/documents/2024_BBB_CUTE-EN.pdf

For information on what you're allowed to change or modify, consult the CUTE.txt. The Conditions d'utilisations typographiques engageantes (CUTE), written by the Bye Bye Binary collective, are a way of bringing together people who design, distribute and use post-binary fonts. These conditions are a kind of contract, a user guide, usable by anyone wishing to publish a post-binary font. Like a license, like a mussel on its rock, this text travels and spreads with the font files as they are downloaded. They stand out from most free licenses by integrating the question of economics and the material conditions of existence of designers. The critical and political ideas that drive them thus pollinate graphic practices committed to a radically feminist, anti-racist, anti-capitalist, queer and trans\* perspective
