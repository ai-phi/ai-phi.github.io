# Velvelyne

Velvelyne is a typeface designed for the Velvetyne website in 2023 by [Manon Van der Borght](/authors/manon-van-der-borght/) and [Mariel Nils](/authors/mariel-nils/). It is now available published under [CUTE licence](https://typo-inclusive.net/conditions-dutilisations-typographiques-engageantes/), written by [Bye Bye Binary](https://typotheque.byebyebinary.space).
Its skeleton was designed by a script imagined by [Benjamin Dumond](http://benjamindumond.fr/). Responding to the orchestration of [RaphaÃ«l Bastide], the shapes grew out of the [Liberation Sans] character (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts). Manon and Mariel then took care of this skeleton until it developed its branches and assumed its outgrowths. As it grew into a stroke font, it expanded into 4 weights and a few post-binary ligatures.
