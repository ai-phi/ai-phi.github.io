## A Creative Community!

It’s heartening to see how deeply our community is infused with **creative energy**!

Earlier on, this year, I finally realised a long-held dream by launching my personal blog on the epistemological, ethical, and metaphysical implications of artificial minds: [Conscienc.AI](https://conscienc.ai/).

Meanwhile, Michael Anslow led the first collective AI-Phi post about [our Causerie on Reasoning](/posts/causerie-on-reasoning) and has since begun a sharp, ongoing series about how generative AI is reshaping humanity [on Medium](https://medium.com/@michael.anslow).

Last month, David Colliaux launched his own blog, ["Mil Lieues”](https://kodda.github.io/millieues) about computation and biology ! _Stefan, we’re waiting for yours next!_ And our dear Sylvy Anscombe opened a [political substack](https://sylvyanscombe.substack.com/).

David’s [latest post](https://kodda.github.io/millieues/posts/2025-10-30-Existential-machines/) is a retrospective on our inaugural AI-Phi 3.0 [session with Dominique Lestel](posts/session-26-lestel-insurrectionary-machines): whether you could join us or not, it provides an interesting summary and perspective. The post is illustrated by Edmund Ronald’s sketch, drawn live during the session:

And there's more: Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis, Adel Chaibi and Hye Young Kim launched [Project.y](https://www.youtube.com/@projet.y): a new YouTube channel where they explore the transformative potential of AI on classical philosophical themes.

AI-Phi is also cooking a new, special collective output for this year… to be published. More details to follow soon!

I’m sure we will see many more creative initiatives shape up rapidly, what an invigorating dynamic!

**Congratulations everyone!** and thanks for the constant inspiration you bring and share with all of us. It is through the conjugation of such rich, diverse sets of expertise and perspectives that AI-Phi _exists_.
