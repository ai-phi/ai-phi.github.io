In this joint session, Lucas Battich (Institut Jean Nicod, ENS-PSL) and David Colliaux (Sony) will combine their knowledge of cognitive science and robotics engineering to explore the notion of agency in humans and in machines.

## Philosophy and Cognitive Science by Lucas Battich

When acting, humans usually have a sense of agency: a feeling or judgment of control over one’s own actions. We introduce the sense of agency and examine its role in humans, in AI, and in improving their interactions.

## Robotics and Engineering by David Colliaux

Agency in the cyber-agro-ecosystem. We will present some theories about minimal agency and an illustration about the distribution of agency in irrigation.
