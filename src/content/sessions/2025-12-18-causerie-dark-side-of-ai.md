This causerie session, shaped by community discussion, will address the systemic challenges of the digital ecosystem.

We will share our knowledge, expertise and individual mitigation strategies as international citizens of the cybersphere.

Key topics (not limited to) we will explore:

1. Digital privacy
2. Surveillance
3. Manipulation
4. Digital Divide
5. Environmental Impact

These issues collectively form a critique of _techno-capitalism_ or the _digital social power_. They highlight how our current technological systems, despite promises of connection and progress, can reinforce inequality, undermine autonomy, and create harm that's unevenly distributed across society.

Our aim will be to raise awareness, strengthen connections as we wrap up 2025 and build future outlooks for the year to come.

🎄 Bring your friends and share a festive spirit. 🌟 We want to hear from everyone.
