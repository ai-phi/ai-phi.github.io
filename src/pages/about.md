After years of friendly discussions about AI and philosophy during afterwork hours, Aïda Elamrani (ENS Ulm), Michael Anslow and Stefan Lattner (both from Sony CSL) decided it was time to turn this energy in something more substantial. AI-PHI was born in the Quartier Latin from their friendship and shared passion.

The AI-PHI community involves researchers and professionals from diverse backgrounds, cultures and disciplines.
