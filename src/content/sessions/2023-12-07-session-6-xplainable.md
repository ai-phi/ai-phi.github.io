Thomas Souverain is a Philosophy PhD Student in AI Ethics, ENS Ulm - Institut Jean Nicod.

After having introduced key principles of AI Ethics, Thomas presented the two main principles which are at the core of his PhD research: Explainability and Fairness.

He also highlighted some limitations of purely technical solutions to explainability and fairness when applied to the settings of loan lending and job offering. These are the cases he is currently focused on with data science teams.
