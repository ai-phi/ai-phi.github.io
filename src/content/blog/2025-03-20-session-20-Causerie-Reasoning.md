The concept of reasoning has deep roots in both AI and philosophy. This has recently re-entered the limelight, sparked by a new paradigm of so-called ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô models such as o1 and DeepSeek.

In our first ‚Äúcauserie‚Äù, we will try to formulate our ideas about reasoning in artificial systems. This format, inspired by the Parisian intellectual salon, consists of a topic and questions to help frame the discussion.

These questions are:

- What is reasoning in an AI system?
- How can we know that an AI system is reasoning?
- What is missing from existing AI systems that prevent them from reasoning effectively?

**Everyone is welcome to share reading material with the group (on our usual channels) or prepare a few slides to add to the discussion.**

We will celebrate this 20th session with a cake ü•≥
