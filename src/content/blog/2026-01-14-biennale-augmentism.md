We’re pleased to share an upcoming event organised by one of our community members, Alexandra Boucherifi-Kornmann: PROXIMA, a new European biennale dedicated to the intersections of art, artificial intelligence, and augmentation technologies, supported by the French Ministry of Culture.

Starting in January 2026, in France and abroad, PROXIMA will bring together exhibitions and round tables exploring how AI and so-called “augmentation technologies” (augmented reality, mapping, QR codes, mixed reality) are reshaping pictorial creation.

## 🔬 A laboratory edition: La Piccola

PROXIMA will open with a laboratory (pilot) edition, conceived as a testing ground ahead of the biennale’s full deployment. Developed without dedicated funding, this first iteration is made possible through the voluntary involvement of artists, researchers, and partners united by the desire to help shape a new European cultural event.

Running from January to April 2026, the programme will unfold across multiple venues, with most exhibitions and talks freely accessible to both the general public and experts.

## 🎯 Purpose & scope

PROXIMA aims to:

- highlight artistic practices integrating AI and augmentation technologies,

- examine their aesthetic, philosophical, and ethical implications,

- foster dialogue between art, technology, and research across Europe.

> Augmentism applies technology to pigment in order to question our contemporary obsession with human augmentation, both artistically and philosophically.

— Alexandra Boucherifi-Kornmann

PROXIMA positions itself as a space for experimentation and dialogue between artists, researchers, and the wider public — and as a prefiguration of a future European biennale devoted to AI-driven artistic creation.
