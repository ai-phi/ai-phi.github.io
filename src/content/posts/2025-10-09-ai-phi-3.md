## A New Edition of AI-Phi

We’re thrilled to launch the third edition of AI-Phi — **AI-Phi 3.0** — with a new visual identity and a few other surprises.

This year marks a new chapter in our community’s journey, and with it comes a transformation in how we present ourselves. Our Creative Director **[Sébastien Marino](https://www.instagram.com/mstheghost/)** has crafted a stunning new visual identity that’s both timeless and deeply rooted in the spirit of AI-Phi.

At the heart of the new design is a symbol he named **Double Conscience** — an abstract mark that evokes duality, tension, and reflection. It's inspired by the textures of prehistoric art, the loops of circuitry, and the unspoken language of perception.

"It is not a message. It is the shape a question leaves behind."

This is more than a logo — it’s a visual philosophy. Sébastien’s creative process combined historical research, linocut textures, and generative scripts to produce a layered, evolving visual language. You’ll see it unfold in our talks, slides, social media, and this very website.

But visuals aren't the only thing we've been rethinking. **AI-Phi 3.0 will bring more than sessions and seminars** — we have a few collaborative and unexpected projects brewing. One of them is a special publication. Another? Well, you’ll have to wait and see.

We’ve also just launched a new presence on social media — including a dedicated **LinkedIn page**.

👉 [Follow us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-phi-paris) to stay connected as the season unfolds.

AI-Phi has always been about sparking conversations at the intersection of philosophy and AI. With AI-Phi 3.0, we’re renewing that commitment — with new energy, new ideas, and a visual identity that reflects the richness and ambiguity of the questions we explore.

We can’t wait to share it all with you.

📅 **In the meantime, save the date: our inaugural session will take place on Thursday, October 23rd at 2PM!** More details soon.
