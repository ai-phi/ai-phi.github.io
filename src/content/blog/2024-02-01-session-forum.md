## About our next session (01-02-2024):

An essential dimension of our community is to build a shared language and vision, shaped by our discussions. Previously, we’ve had several captivating sessions (Effective Altruism, Explainable AI and AEmotional Understanding), which all sparked thought-provoking debates. They deserve more thorough consideration and deliberation.

In this session, we will deep dive into several topics in small discussion groups, debate, put our thoughts together, reinforce the links between us and envision the future of AI-PHI. Don’t worry if you missed a session, your participation is always welcome.
