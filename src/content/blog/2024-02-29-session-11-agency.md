In this joint session, Lucas Battich (Institut Jean Nicod, ENS-PSL) and David Colliaux (Sony) will combine their knowledge of cognitive science and robotics engineering to explore the notion of agency in humans and in machines.

## Philosophy and Cognitive Science by Lucas Battich

When acting, humans usually have a sense of agency: a feeling or judgment of control over one’s own actions. We introduce the sense of agency and examine its role in humans, in AI, and in improving their interactions.

Lucas Battich is a researcher in cognitive science and philosophy of mind at the Institut Jean Nicod, École Normale Supérieure Paris. He researches how our perception and cognition of the world may be influenced by others, and brings together perception, metacognition, and social cognition. He has a keen interest in how AI can help understand these human capacities, and conversely how these capacities may play a role in artificial systems and human-AI interactions.

## Robotics and Engineering by David Colliaux

Agency in the cyber-agro-ecosystem. We will present some theories about minimal agency and an illustration about the distribution of agency in irrigation.
