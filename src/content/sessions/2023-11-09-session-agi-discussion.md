## About the 4th session:

Last time we had an ambitious, whirlwind tour of Artificial Intelligence and we began to explore the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

In our 4th session, we will complete the presentation on "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)" by Michael Anslow and take the necessary breathing room for a long, open discussion on the topic.
