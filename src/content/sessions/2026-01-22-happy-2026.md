Looking back at AI in 2025, looking ahead to 2026

A new year, a new AI-Phi community session.

We’ll take a collective step back to review the major developments in AI throughout 2025, then look forward together and formulate predictions for 2026 — technical, conceptual, social, ethical, and philosophical.

The discussion will be facilitated by Michael Anslow, in an open, collaborative format. Everyone is warmly invited to contribute their own observations, intuitions, and bets about where AI is heading.

🎯 Challenge
At the end of the session, we’ll keep track of the predictions made.
The most insightful (or uncannily accurate) prediction will earn its author an AI-Phi t-shirt in 2027 — because good foresight deserves delayed gratification.

🧭 Also on the agenda
We’ll take some time to discuss the evolution of AI-Phi itself: where the community is heading, what formats we want to nurture, and how AI-Phi continues to grow as a space for critical, interdisciplinary exchange.

Whether you’ve been with AI-Phi since the beginning or are joining for the first time, this session is an invitation to think together, speculate responsibly, and shape what comes next.

Everyone is welcome.
Bring your questions, your doubts, and your predictions.
