We’re happy to announce the closing session of the first year of ai-phi, this Thursday, the 13th of June.
This session will be dedicated to a retrospective on this past year, and discussions about the future of our community (if weather allows, in the garden!).

Thank you again for your participation and insights throughout this adventure!
